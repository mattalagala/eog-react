### UI

The UI features a drop down selector to choose the metrics avaialble to trend.
ReCharts then renders a chart based on the user selection.
The current selection name and selection value are displayed in the top right corner.
Historical data renders on the chart for 30 periods.

### Conclusion

I INCREDIBLY enjoyed this assessment. Unfortunately due to current time constraints, I wasn't able to get some of the features as polished as I liked to. I enjoyed utilizing GraphQL and Recharts for real-time applications and plan perfect its implementation over time. I appreciate this opportuninty to assess with the EOG Software Team this was an extremely practical assessment and I was thoroughly impressesed by the react dashboard and its user experience. I plan to continue working on this project and add features over my journey as a React engineer.

Thank you for your consideration.
